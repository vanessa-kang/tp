## FAQ

Question Type|Question|Answer
:---:|---|---
General | How do I check which modules are offered by NUS? | For more info on which modules are offered by NUS, visit [here](https://nusmods.com/modules?sem[0]=1&sem[1]=2&sem[2]=3&sem[3]=4 "NUSMODS").
General | What is a valid semester index? | For the purpose of this planning software, we have come to a decision to limit the maximum number of semesters an undergraduate can take to 10, which is 5 academic years. The notation they are represented by is by an integer of value 1 to 10. For a fresh undergraduate, they will begin at semester index of 1. For a year 3 student who is currently in semester 1, the semester index will be 5. Please refer to the appendix for more information.
General | What is a valid grade? | **Letter Grades**: A+, A, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D+, D, F , **Special Grades**: CS, CU, S, U, W, IC, IP, AUD, WU, EXE, **If you have yet to have a grade for the module**: NT
General | What is the name of the saved file? | The name of the saved file is `PlanNUS.txt` and can be found at the base of the folder, in the same location as your PlanNUS.jar.

## Appendix

### Naming convention for semester indexes

For the purpose of this planning software, we have decided to limit the maximum number of semesters an undergraduate can take to 10, which is equivalent to 5 academic years. Each semester is indexed by an integer between 1 to 10. For a fresh undergraduate, they will begin at semester index of 1. For a year 3 student who is currently in semester 1, the semester index will be 5. Below is a table which illustrates the corresponding semester indexes for undergraduates.

| Academic Year | Semester (as of Academic Year) | Semester Index |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------: | :------------: |
|       1       |               1                |       1        |
|       1       |               2                |       2        |
|       2       |               1                |       3        |
|       2       |               2                |       4        |
|       3       |               1                |       5        |

### Grade values

As per NUS Grade Policy, letter grades will have a corresponding Academic Point attached to them. Special cases such as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SU) grades can be captured by our software as well. Below is a table of grades and their corresponding grade value. Do note that the grades of forecasted modules should be declared as NT, short for Not Taken.

|            Grade            | Academic Points |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------: |
|             A+              |       5.0       |
|              A              |       5.0       |
|             A-              |       4.5       |
