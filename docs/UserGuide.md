#### Adding a module into the calendar: `add`

Input format: `add <module code>`

Example of usage: 

* `add CS2113T`
* `ADD cs2101`

Upon entering the desired module, user will be prompted to enter the semester when this module had been or to be taken before keying in the grade as shown in the image below.

__<ins>Caution</ins>:__ 

* Invalid module codes (i.e. Modules not offered by NUS) cannot be added into the calendar
* Duplicate module codes cannot be added into the calendar as well

#### Removing an existing module in the calendar: `remove`

Input format: `remove <module code>`

Example of usage:

* `remove cs2113T`
* `REMOVE CS2101`

<img src="images/remove_module.png" width = "350" height = "50" />

* `EDIT cs2101`

<img src="images/edit_module.png" width = "600" />

As shown in the image, user can choose to edit either the _Semester_ or _Grade_ of the selected module. (__Note:__ Enter either `1` or `2` instead of the component's name)

Expected output when user wishes to change the _Semester_.

<img src="images/capcalc_features.png" height = "180" />

Input format: `capcalc`

#### Printing current CAP and MCs taken: `current`

The value of CAP depends entirely on the modules and with corresponding grades added by the user in Academic Calendar Planner.

<img src="images/capcalc_current.png" width = "340" />

Input format: `current`

__<ins>Caution:</ins>__

* If there are no modules added, the current CAP and graded MCs are set to 0

#### Set target CAP: `set target`

This is for the user to set a target CAP that he or she wishes to obtain for the next specified graded MCs.

<img src="images/capcalc_set_target.png" height = "130" />

Input format: `set target`

__<ins>Caution:</ins>__

* Maximum CAP is 5.0



### Exiting from a feature or PlanNUS: `exit`

This command directs user back to the main page of PlanNUS after they are done using a feature or exits from the entire application itself.

When user exits from the Academic Planner, expected output is as shown below.

<img src="images/exit_acadplan.png" width = "350"/>

When user exits from the CAP calculator, expected output will be as follows:

<img src="images/exit_capcalc.png" width = "350"/>

Last but not least, the expected output for exiting PlanNUS will be as such:

<img src="images/exit_PlanNUS.png" width = "430" />

## Appendix

### Naming convention for semester indexes

For the purpose of this planning software, we have decided to limit the maximum number of semesters an undergraduate can take to 10, which is equivalent to 5 academic years. Each semester is indexed by an integer between 1 to 10. For a fresh undergraduate, they will begin at semester index of 1. For a year 3 student who is currently in semester 1, the semester index will be 5. Below is a table which illustrates the corresponding semester indexes for undergraduates.

| Academic Year | Semester (as of Academic Year) | Semester Index |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------: | :------------: |
|       1       |               1                |       1        |
|       1       |               2                |       2        |
|       2       |               1                |       3        |
|       2       |               2                |       4        |
|       3       |               1                |       5        |
|       3       |               2                |       6        |
|       4       |               1                |       7        |
|       4       |               2                |       8        |
|       5       |               1                |       9        |
|       5       |               2                |       10       |



### Grade values

As per NUS Grade Policy, letter grades will have a corresponding Academic Point attached to them. Special cases such as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SU) grades can be captured by our software as well. Below is a table of grades and their corresponding grade value. Do note that the grades of forecasted modules should be declared as NT, short for Not Taken.

|            Grade            | Academic Points |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------: |
|             A+              |       5.0       |
|              A              |       5.0       |
|             A-              |       4.5       |

|              B              |       3.5       |
