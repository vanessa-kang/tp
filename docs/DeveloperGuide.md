## Setting up PlanNUS

First and foremost, the following steps are assuming that you already have a [GitHub](github.com) account set up beforehand. Once this has been done, proceed to __fork__ this [repo](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-1/tp), and __clone__ the fork into your computer using [Sourcetree](<sourcetreeapp.com>) or any other _Git GUI_.

The _IDE_ to be used should contain the latest version of _Java_ as this is the main programming language for this application. Thus you are highly recommended to use Intellij IDEA.

The following are remaining steps to be taken to finish the set up:

1. Make sure that the version is configured as __JDK 11__.
2. When prompted, __import__ the project as a __Gradle project__ (could take minutes to complete).
3. Enter commands to ensure that PlanNUS functions as expected. You may refer to the _User Guide_ for valid commands.



## Design

### Architecture

![Architecture](./images/DeveloperGuide/Architecture.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of PlanNus. Below is a quick overview of each component.



#### PlanNus

`PlanNus` class contains the `main` and `run` method, which is responsible for

  * At launch

       * Loading all modules for AY2020/21 into PlanNus

       * Loading previous save file into PlanNus if available

       * Creation of entry point to available app in PlanNus

  * While running

       * Continuously prompt user for app selection

  * At shut down

       * Saving of user data into save file
       * Clean up methods where necessary



#### Global, Ui, Parser, Storage

* The `global` package contains classes, exceptions and objects that are required across the whole app. 
* The `ui` package contains the class that is responsible for sharing one `scanner` class across the whole app to prevent multiple IO streams
* The `parser` package contains the class that handles user's app selection
* The `storage` package handles loading and saving of user's data to a save file.
